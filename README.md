Preparation for the R user conference 2014

## Requirements for Posters

Abstracts accepted for posters will take place during one of two evening poster sessions. Poster sessions are a social event. There are no parallel talks or events happening, so everyone can talk and stop by posters they are interested in. The dimensions of each poster should not exceed 4' x 4' or 120cm x 120cm.
